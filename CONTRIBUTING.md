### Code Conventions

Please try to follow the conventions that are currently in place.

### Testing

There is currently test coverage using Mocha, Chai, Sinon, and PhantomJS.
Testing any new modules is highly encouraged. See the `test` directory for
examples of how to test your modules. If you need to use PhantomJS in order
to test in a browser environment, see `test/optimizely-jquery-polyfill.html` and
`test/fixtures/src/optimizely-jquery-polyfill.js` for an example of how to do so.
Run `gulp` to make sure your code lints and your tests pass.
