# `clearhead` [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/clearhead/clearhead.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/clearhead/clearhead)

TODO: Quick marketing use case / maybe a screenshot

## Installation

```shell
# npm install phantomjs -g
npm install --save-dev clearhead
```

## Usage

### Standalone

Make sure browserify is installed, either in your project or globally (`npm install browserify -g`)

```javascript
//test.js
var slugify = require('clearhead/slugify');

var articleTitle = 'How to use the Clearhead module library!';
var articleSlug = slugify(articleTitle);
```
Build your code: `browserify test.js -o output.js`

### Inside a project

```javascript
import timpl from 'clearhead/timpl';
```

NOTE: ES6 +browserify compilation best used alongside `gulp-clearbuild`

# Modules

### async

Provides a method of avoiding nested callbacks when performing multiple asynchronous operations (note that this module does not enforce that the operations be asynchronous). The module exposes two methods `series` and `waterfall`.

**series(queue, iterator, [done])**

Applies the function `iterator` to each item in the `queue` array, in sequence.
The `iterator` is called with an item from the list, and a done callback for when it
has finished.

```javascript
import { series } from 'clearhead/async';

// Sum array items asynchronously using a series.
series([1, 2, 3, 4], (curr, next, prev = 0) => {
	// curr => the current item value
	// prev => the previous item value
	// next => the callback function with previous bound to the current item or the first argument passed to next on the previous iteration.
  setTimeout(() => {
    next(prev + curr);
  }, 0);
}, (result) => {
  // do something with the result
});
```

**waterfall(queue)**

Runs the `queue` array of functions in sequence, each passing its results to the next in
the array.

```javascript
import { waterfall } from 'clearhead/async';

waterfall([
	function start(next) {
		next(0);
	},
	function add2(running, next) {
		next(running + 2);
	},
	function multiplyBy5(running, next) {
		next(running * 5);
	},
	function(result) {
		// do something with the result
	},
]);
```

### batch

Breaks an array into smaller arrays of a given length.

```javascript
import batch from 'clearhead/batch';

var longArray = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine'];
var smallerArrays = batch(longArray, 2);

/*

smallerArrays -> [
	['zero', 'one'],
	['two', 'three'],
	['four', 'five'],
	['six', 'seven'],
	['eight', 'nine']
]

*/
```

### console-polyfill

@tomfuertes - Can you help fill in a description and example for this one?

```javascript
//example code here
```

### cookie

Sets, gets, and deletes a cookie with a given name, value, and optional expiration date (in days).

```javascript
import cookie from 'clearhead/cookie';

var cookieName = 'the-name-of-my-cookie';
var cookieVal = 'the-value-of-my-cookie';

cookie.set(cookieName, cookieVal, 365);
cookie.get(cookieName); //Outputs 'the-value-of-my-cookie'
cookie.del(cookieName);
```
### coremetrics

Sends information to CoreMetrics

```javascript
import coremetrics from 'clearhead/coremetrics';

coremetrics(0123456789);
```

### curry

Returns a curried function that will not be called until all arguments received.

```javascript
import curry from 'clearhead/curry';

var madlib = curry(function(pronoun, adjective, noun) {
	console.log(pronoun+' is a '+adjective+' '+noun);
});

var myMadlib = madlib('Tesla');
//...
myMadlib = myMadlib('awesome');
//...
myMadlib('scientist');
```

### debounce

Prevents a function from being recalled repeatedly. The function will be called again after it stops being called for N milliseconds.

See https://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-throttling-and-debouncing/ for a good writeup for the difference between debounce and throttle.

```javascript
import debounce from 'clearhead/debounce';

//The inner function will only be called after the user has stopped scrolling for 100ms
$(window).on('scroll', debounce(function() {
  console.log('The user started scrolling and this function didn\'t execute until there was a 100ms break in the scrolling');
}, 100));
```

### domready

Runs a function on domready - to be used on sites that don't have jQuery right away and/or not at all but you need to wait till the DOM is ready to run something.
```javascript
import domready from 'clearhead/domready';

domready(function() {
	console.log('The dom is ready! Do your thing.');
});
```

### get-param

Gets a param value from location.search.

```javascript
import getParam from 'clearhead/get-param';

//When run on the page: http://test.com?name=bob
console.log(getParam('name')); //Outputs: "bob"
```

### goal
Fires strings into auto-detected analytics installs.

```javascript
const goal = require('clearhead/goal').bind(null, 'exp1-foo');

goal('click', '#bar');
```

### google-analytics

Sends information to googleAnalytics.

```javascript
import googleAnalytics from 'clearhead/google-analytics';

googleAnalytics(1234567, 'my-custom-variable');
```

### google-tag-manager

Exposes information to googleTagManager by setting a global variable.

```javascript
import googleTagManager from 'clearhead/google-tag-manager';

googleTagManager(1234567, 'my-custom-variable');
```

### load-css

Loads a CSS file asynchronously.

```javascript
import loadCSS from 'clearhead/load-css';

loadCSS('../styles/styles.css', null, media);
```

### load-script

Loads a script and fires callback.

```javascript
import loadScript from 'clearhead/load-script';

function optCallBack() {
  console.log('my callback function is firing after the script loads!');
};
loadScript('../src/main.js', optCallBack);
```

### log

Like a regular console.log but only fires in dev environments (localhost, preview links, debug cookies etc) so you can leave it in your code while pushing to production.

```javascript
import log from 'clearhead/log';

log('Something is happening'); //Outputs to the console when run from http://localhost:8000/ but not http://clientwebsite.com
```

### notify

Notify.js is a jQuery plugin to provide simple yet fully customisable notifications.

```javascript
import notify from 'clearhead/notify';

$.notify('Hello!');

// or pass in optional message style (e.g. success, info, warn, or error)
$.notify('Uh oh!', 'warn');
```

### object-assign-polyfill

Gives all browsers object.assign capabilities.

```javascript
import anything from 'clearhead/object-assign-polyfill';

var obj = { a: 1 };
var copy = Object.assign({}, obj);
console.log(copy); // { a: 1 }
```

### onload-css

Adds onload support for asynchronous stylesheets loaded with loadCSS. Used with loadCSS above.

```javascript
import onloadCSS from 'clearhead/onload-css';

var stylesheet = loadCSS('path/to/mystylesheet.css');
onloadCSS(stylesheet, function() {
    console.log('Stylesheet has asynchronously loaded.');
});
```

### optimizely-jquery-polyfill

Returns a pollyfilled jQuery.

```javascript
import pollyfill from 'clearhead/optimizely-jquery-polyfill';

pollyfill($); // local ref to optimizely.$
```

### preload

Preloads images.

```javascript
import preload from 'clearhead/preload';

var arrayOfLoadedImages = preload('./imgs/img01.jpg', './imgs/img02.jpg', './imgs/img03.jpg', './imgs/img04.jpg');
```

### report

Sends an error back to GA as events for wallboards. Why a module? Because not all clients load window.ga so this just reverse engineers the endpoint using a beacon.

```javascript
//example code here
```

### return-visitor

Fires code when a user returns to an experiment.

```javascript
import returnVisitor from 'clearhead/return-visitor';

returnValue('unique-name-for-tracking-users-for-just-this-call', function() {
	console.log('The user was last here over 30min ago');
});
```

### slugify

Returns the 'slug' of a string (replaces non-word characters with hyphens).

```javascript
import slugify from 'clearhead/slugify';

var articleTitle = 'How to use the Clearhead module library!';
var articleSlug = slugify(articleTitle);
console.log(articleSlug); //Outputs: how-to-use-the-clearhead-module-library
```

### store

Exposes a simple pattern to get / set from localStorage.

```javascript
import store from 'clearhead/store';

store.set('key', 'value');
store.get('key'); //Returns 'value'
store.del('key');
```

### throttle

Borrowed from http://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html

Returns a function, that, when invoked, will only be triggered at most once during a given window of time. Normally, the throttled function will run as much as it can, without ever going more than once per wait duration; but if youâ€™d like to disable the execution on the leading edge, pass {leading: false}. To disable execution on the trailing edge, ditto.

See https://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-throttling-and-debouncing/ for a good writeup for the difference between throttle and debounce.

```javascript
import throttle from 'clearhead/throttle';

//The inner function will only be called every 100ms while the user is scrolling
$(window).on('scroll', throttle(function() {
  console.log('You\'ll see this message every 100ms while the user is still scrolling');
}, 100));
```

### timpl

Uses double-handlebar syntax to template a string with a data object.

```javascript
import timpl from 'clearhead/timpl';

console.log(timpl('<div>{{name}}</div>', {name: 'Bob'})); //Outputs: <div>Bob</div>
```

### track

Sends a prop to SiteCatalyst.

```javascript
const track = require('clearhead/track').bind(null, 'prop52');

track('some-event');
```

### universal-analytics

Sends information to Google Universal Analytics.

```javascript
import universalAnalytics from 'clearhead/universal-analytics';

universalAnalytics(1234567, 'my-custom-variable');
```

### when

Polls for a jQuery element, and executes code when the element is found. Also can have optional timeout.

```javascript
function callBackFun() {
  console.log('it happened!');
};

when($('.this-div'), callBackFun, 500);
```

### wrap

Helper pattern for try / catch / report.

```javascript
// example code here
```
